            Marvel's Iron Fist, or simply Iron Fist, is an American television series created by Scott Buck for the streaming service Netflix, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise and is the fourth in a series of shows that lead to The Defenders crossover miniseries. The series is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Devilina Productions and showrunner Buck for the first season. Raven Metzner took over as showrunner for the second season.

            Finn Jones stars as Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon a mystical power known as the "Iron Fist". Jessica Henwick, Tom Pelphrey, Jessica Stroup, and Sacha Dhawan also star, with Ramón Rodríguez, Rosario Dawson and David Wenham joining them for the first season, Simone Missick and Alice Eve joining the cast for season two. After a film based on the character spent over a decade in development at Marvel Studios, development for the series began in late 2013 at Marvel Television, with Buck hired as the series showrunner in December 2015 and Jones cast as Rand in February 2016. Metzner was revealed as the series' new showrunner in July 2017. Filming for the series takes place in New York City.
            
            The first season, consisting of 13 episodes, was released on March 17, 2017. It received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite the critical reception, third-party data analytics determined the series had strong viewership. A second season, consisting of 10 episodes, was ordered in July 2017, and was released on September 7, 2018 to an improved critical reception. On October 12, 2018, Netflix canceled the series after two seasons. 
            Premise
